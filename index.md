# Welcome
My name is Okezie Okpara,
I am a software engineer, DevOps engineer and software architect.
These days I specialize in Cloud Infrastructure management, incident management and Site reliability engineering. Generally, I plan and deploy infrastructure and troubleshoot issues on production.
Recently, I am launching this thing to help small software companies set up their own internal technical support/SRE practices. So basically I will provide them with templates and procedures. 

Most saas startups cannot guarantee their users uptime, because they lack internal processes for identifying and responding to incidences. 
Help you set up monitoring and metrics

Starting a practice to help software companies set up their DevOps, technical support and Site reliability engineering (SRE) practices. 
1. Setup processes for incidence management and reporting.
reviews.
2. Help set up, configure and optimize proactive monitoring.
3. Setup processes for on-call rotation for support engineers.
4. Provide templates for escalation policies. Setup PagerDuty, OpsGenie etc
5. Setup processes for change requests, maintenance windows
6. provide template handling incidences and outages, outage communications and producing root-cause analysis (RCA).
7. SLA policies, uptime  tracking and metrics etc
8. JIRA automation, metrics and reporting
9. Personnel training, hiring, performance tracking processes

This will be done on a consulting basis and you only get to pay for hours of hands-on work. Which is far cheaper than hiring in-house.
I am accepting a few companies currently. To get started click here and provide some basic details and I will get back to you.
